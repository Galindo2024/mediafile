  <h2>Song Lyrics</h2>
<ul> 
  <li>Verse 1: Remember the words you told me, love me 'til the day I die<br>
Surrender my everything 'cause you made me believe you're mine<br>
Yeah, you used to call me baby, now you calling me by name<br>
Takes one to know one, yeah<br>
You beat me at my own damn game<br></li>
<li>Pre-Chorus: You push and you push and I'm pulling away<br>
Pulling away from you<br>
I give and I give and I give and you take, give and you take<br></li>
<li>Chorus: Youngblood<br>
Say you want me<br>
Say you want me<br>
Out of your life<br>
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight<br>
But you need it, yeah, you need it<br>
All of the time<br>
Yeah, ooh ooh ooh<br>
Youngblood<br>
Say you want me<br>
Say you want me<br>
Back in your life<br>
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight<br>
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it<br>
All of the time<br>
Yeah, ooh ooh ooh<br></li> 
<li>Lately our conversations end like it's the last goodbye<br>
Yeah, one of us gets too drunk and calls about a hundred times<br>
So who you been calling, baby, nobody could take my place<br>
When you're looking at those strangers, hope to God you see my face<br></li>
<li>Chorus: Youngblood<br>
Say you want me<br>
Say you want me<br>
Out of your life<br>
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight<br>
But you need it, yeah, you need it<br>
All of the time<br>
Yeah, ooh ooh ooh<br>
Youngblood<br>
Say you want me<br>
Say you want me<br>
Back in your life<br>
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight<br>
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it<br>
All of the time<br>
Yeah, ooh ooh ooh
You push and you push and I'm pulling away<br>
Pulling away from you<br>
I give and I give and I give and you take, give and you take<br></li>
<li>Bridge:You're running around and I'm running away<br>
Running away from you, from you<br>
Youngblood<br>
Say you want me<br>
Say you want me<br>
Out of your life<br>
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight<br>
But you need it, yeah, you need it<br>
All of the time<br>
Yeah, ooh ooh ooh<br>
Youngblood<br>
Say you want me<br>
Say you want me<br>
Back in your life<br>
So I'm just a dead man crawling tonight<br>
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it<br>
All of the time<br>
Yeah, ooh ooh ooh<br></li>
<li>Outro: You push and you push and I'm pulling away<br>
Pulling away from you<br>
I give and I give and I give and you take, give and you take<br>
Youngblood<br>
Say you want me<br>
Say you want me<br>
Out of your life<br>
And I'm just a dead man walking tonight<br></li>
